The vast majority of cross-national evidence about ethnic diversity and governance uses the standard measure of ELF (e.g., Alesina et al. 2003; Alesina and La Ferrara 2005; Collier 2000; Easterly and Levine 1997; La Porta et al. 1999). This measure contains information about the identity and size of groups but incorporates no other information about groups\' substantive charac- teristics',

  //       'Which measure of ethnic diversity shows the strongest association with public goods provision? We do not find a robust empirical relationship between either the standard ELF measure or measures of cul- tural difference and public goods provision. However, the tests do reveal that between-group inequality has a large, robust negative relationship with public goods provision. Countries with higher levels of inequality between groups have lower levels of public goods, a finding that has important implications for understand- ing the pathways by which ethnic diversity creates gov- ernance problems.',
  //       'This article demonstrates that it is possible to mea- sure differences in the economic well-being of groups using existing cross-national surveys of citizens. Specif- ically, we use between-group inequality (BGI), which is a weighted average of the differences in mean in- comes across groups in a country, as a measure of economic differences between groups.',

This measure is based on the familiar Gini index, but instead of calculating inequality based on each individ- ual\'s income, it assigns each group\'s mean income to every member of that group.

  //       'Like the Gini, BGI ranges from 0 to 1. It takes on its minimum value of 0 when the average incomes of all groups in society are the same, and it takes on its',
  //       'maximum value of 1 when one infinitely small group controls all the income in society.',        
  //       'The empirical analysis tells a clear story. First, and most important, we find a strong and robust relation- ship between the level of public goods provision and between-group inequality. In contrast, neither tradi- tional measures of ELF nor cultural differences be- tween groups (measured using information about the languages groups speak) has such a relationship. Sec- ond, although there are clear limits on how hard we can push our data, we have suggestive evidence that between-group economic differences lead to lower public goods provision, particularly in the less estab- lished democracies. Third, we find that when control- ling for group economic differences, the overall level of inequality itself has no impact on public goods provi- sion. The analysis therefore strongly suggests that pay- ing more attention to group economic differences will yield strong dividends in efforts to understand the im- pacts of ethnic diversity and inequality on governance.']

Text analysis of these messages provides a detailed measure of individ- uals\' spontaneous affective expressions across the globe.

LIWC contains lists of words or word stems that measure 64 behavioral and psychological dimensions, including PA and NA, as well as "anxiousness," "anger," and "in- hibition." These lists were created using emotion rating scales and thesauruses and validated by independent judges. Bantum and Owen (18) found that for all emotional expression words, LIWC\'s sensitivity and specificity values were 0.88 and 0.97, respectively.
